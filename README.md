# Open Realtime API Embedded

This repo contains links to use the [OpenAI Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) with [WebRTC](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc) on different embedded platforms.

## Espressif (ESP32)

Espressif maintains a offical example at [openai_demo](https://github.com/espressif/esp-webrtc-solution/tree/main/solutions/openai_demo).

The original implementation of the OpenAI Embedded SDK is still available on the `esp32` branch.
